This is a small script dedicated to trancribing animal information to a Lua table. This may be useful when adding animals to [Module:Animals/data/stats](https://tamingio.fandom.com/wiki/Module:Animals/data/stats).
* To use it, paste the index.js file on your console.
* If you want to look at the source code, check the index.ts file.

You can interact with it via JS, but the easiest way to use it is to enter the animal's Tamodex and click the copy button, next to the pet cards button, where it will be directly added to your clipboard. To paste the code, just paste it with Ctrl + V or right clicking and selecting "Paste".
